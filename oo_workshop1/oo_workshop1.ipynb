We could do all the same things we have done so far with separate variables for each component of each vector and we could use functions instead of methods, as we did in the beginning of the workshop. But if we did that it would be much more complicated to maintain, we would have to keep track of all these myriad of different variables and what they mean and how they fit together, we'd also have to keep track of what variables needed to be passed to which functions. \n",
