      "<blockquote>Experimental work resembles the actions of a child that receives a big wrapped present, and without opening it, by shaking it in his hands and hearing the sound it makes, has to infer what is inside the box and how it works. Simulation on the other hand, is like starting with an empty box, fill it with pieces that we know well, close and wrap the box, and shake it to hear the sound it makes. By comparing the two sounds, we may be able to understand nature a little better.\n",

      "## The model\n",
      "\n",
      "We are aiming to create a program to describe the motion of an ensemble of classical particles in a 2 dimensional space. Unlike the ideal gas model, we will consider that the particles possess volume (area in 2D) and therefore collide with each other. Apart from these collisions we consider no other interaction between particles. Such a system is identical to that programmed by Nick Brooks as [demonstrations for the Chemical Equilibria course](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry-teaching/chemicalequilibria/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Such simulation is one of the simplest examples of a class of simulation methods called [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics), describing the time evolution of an ensemble of particles according to classical dynamics. In spite of its simplicity, such hard disks model is able to give insight on important results from thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, the structure of dense fluids, or phase transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The description of the dynamical state of the system involves the determination of the position $\\vec{r}_i(t)$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_i(t)$ (or velocity) of each particle of the system at each moment of time. For systems of N particles (where N is usually fairly large) it is in general not possible to write a closed form mathematical expression for how these quantities vary in time. The solution to this problem is to use numerical methods by which, starting from a given initial state, the system is propagated forward in time by a small discrete amount $\\Delta t$ (called a time step), and new the position and momentum are calculated for every particle for time $t+\\Delta t$. By repeating this process over and over again, it is possible to obtain a \"picture\" of the system at small intervals of time and thus monitor its evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our simulation will thus be:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Create an ensemble of particles with positions in a bound region of space with size L&times;L, each with a well defined momentum and mass.\n",
      "* Sequentially updating the position and momenta of these particles in small time steps, keeping a registry of the configurations taken by the system over time."

      "## Outline of the program design\n",
      "\n",
      "Our task is thus to write a program to implement the simulation of the system outlined above. The object-oriented approach is actually quite helpful in these early stages of the design in deciding how to structure our program. This exercise is usually better done with pen and paper with a few schematics than in front of a computer keyboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most simple terms, our simulation can be viewed as an ensemble of particles that need to be propagated in time. We can thus think of two distinct classes of objects:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Particle class, denoting the state of an individual particle at a given moment in time. This should be a fairly simple class.\n",
      "* Simulation class, responsible for the time propagation of an ensemble of Particle objects. This is where most of the work will be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time evolution of the particles should be a relatively simple affair since particles don't interact (except for collisions), each particle should follow uniform linear motion (constant velocity) until an elastic collision occurs with another particle or the container walls, in which case we need to work out how to update the momenta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this 2 class design is not unique. There could for example be several advantages in creating a third class representing the state of the box as a collection of particles at each time step. A Simulation object would then propagate these box objects in time. We will however stick to two class design.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall slowly build all the functionality of the simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* First we will crate a Particle class with the particle attributes.\n",
      "* We will then see how to propagate this particle in time in the absence of collisions.\n",
      "* The create a Simulation class to propagate an ensemble of non-colliding particles.\n",
      "* The most tricky bit of the simulation will be to implement the behaviour when collisions occur. First, collisions with the container walls (easier), then between particles (less simple).\n",
      "* After having a working simulation, we will look at some properties of the systems we are simulating."

      "Our simulation is quite slow (you can see where the code is spending its time by including %%prun at the top of a cell and then executing your simulation code). Most of the computational expense is in the particle collisions because there are N(N-1)/2 pairs of particles. One way to reduce this expense is to divide the box up into quadrants, keep track of which quadrant the particles are in and then when executing the particle_collision code only look for collisions between pairs of particles in the same quadrant. Care needs to be taken when thinking about particles on the edges of the quadrants. Can you speed up the code in this way?"
